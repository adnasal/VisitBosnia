# VisitBosnia
VisitBosnia is a new project that will make travel easier for tourists and locals. The aim of the project is to bring and promote all tourists attractions, restaurants, fast foods, hotels and other businesses divided in four categories (catering, accomodation, sights and adventure) together in one place so that people can easily travel around the city or visitors can schedule their trip ahead of time. Every place added to the website will contain detailed description and details such as its location, price (if applicable), web site, phone number, and so on. Businesses will be grouped based on the city. Being a country with beautiful and breathtaking places, we believe that Bosnia and Herzegovina's charm are not used to its greatest potential. In order to reduce the difficulties navigating through the country for both groups, we decided to unify all the interesting sites.
